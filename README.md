The S32K3 family includes Arm Cortex-M7-based MCUs in single, dual and lockstep core configurations
supporting ASIL B/D safety applications. Features include a hardware security engine with NXP firmware,
support for firmware over-the-air (FOTA) updates and free ISO 26262 compliant real-time software
drivers for AUTOSAR and non-AUTOSAR. S32K3 MCUs are available in NXPâ€™s new MaxQFP package, which
